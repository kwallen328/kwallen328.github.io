<h2>About Me</h2>

<div>
    <p>My name is Kaylan Wallen. I'm a Journalism Student in my junior year at the University of Maryland, College Park. I aspire to become a Producer and Screenwriter at a movie studio or a television network, but for now I'm focused on getting my dream internships. Journanlism has been a passion of mine since my childhood. However, I really fell in love with it in high school, thanks to my School Newspaper/ Yearbook Editor and Chief and my Broadcast Journalism teacher.</p> 

       <p> In my spare time I enjoy drawing, hanging out with my dog Asia, upcycling clothes, and going to record shops. I like to listen to all types of music but my all time favorite genre would have to be Rock n' Roll. I also love to watch old movies like "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes", as well as reading biographies and classic liturature. My favorite book is "The Great Gatsby."</p>
