<h1>Female rappers aren’t vulgar, they're just comfortable with their sexuality.</h1>
<h2>
    <strong>Female Rappers have similar lyrics to their male counterparts, yet they're diminished for it.</strong>

    <p>The controversy surrounding the lyrics of female rappers for their hypersexual lyrics has been on the rise. However, while a female rapper’s lyrics can be deemed ‘vuglar’, a male rapper’s lyrics are praised. Despite having the same hypersexual themes.</p>
<h3>Male Dominated?</h3>
    <p>Hip-Hop has always been a male dominated genre since its creation in the Bronx in the 1970s, and female rappers have been on the rise since. In the 90’s female rappers were still few and far between but as of 2020 female rappers seem to dominate the billboard charts. Female rappers like Megan Thee Stallion and Cardi B have built their brand around female empowerment and confidence through their lyrics and visuals, taking back control of a male dominated genre. According to Complex, “In a male-dominated genre that is often criticized for misogynistic wordplay toward women, the two rappers have never shied away from taking back the narrative of femininity in hip-hop.”</p>

<p>Despite the hypersexual lyrics ‘WAP’ by Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion held impressive records on the charts. According to Complex, “The song and video were an immediate success. “WAP” debuted at No. 1 on US Spotify and No. 6 on Global Spotify with 2.34 million and 3.75 million streams, respectively. It also debuted at No. 1 on US Apple Music.”</p>

<p>The song ‘Wap’ by Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion, as well as the video is riddled with female empowerment. While the song is filled with hypersexual lyrics and innuendos, the video showcases women of many backgrounds as sex symbols. According to Complex, “According to complex, “Through cocky, self-assured lyrics, the duo own their sexuality and shine light on other prominent sex symbols and female musicians, including Normani, Rosalía, Mulatto, Sukihana, Rubi Rose and Kylie Jenner,”.”</p>

<h3>Paving The Way</h3>

<p>The road of success for current female rappers was paved by their predecessors Trina, Lil Kim, Khia, Foxy Brown and Missy Elliot, to name a few. All where sex positive during their time leaving a metaphorical door open for those who came after them. According to Complex, “Walking in the footsteps of iconic sex-positive female rappers like Trina, Lil Kim, and Khia, Cardi and Megan splash around in a pool of water (which we can assume is symbolism for… yup) and describe in detail what a night in bed with them might be like.”</p>

<p>Despite the support from fans female rappers get criticism from multiple places. A prominent point of contention from Hip-Hop as a genre and for female rappers are the church and politicians. Religious politicians seem to think that just because a woman raps about her body in a sexual manner that she has lose morals and wasn’t raised with god. According to Complex, “One politician, James P. Bradley, went so far to claim that “Cardi B & Megan Thee Stallion are what happens when children are raised without God and without a strong father figure,” an immensely controversial statement, especially given that Megan’s father passed away when she was 15.” However, female rappers like Megan Thee Stallion and Cardi B are comfortable and confident in their bodies. Their faith has nothing to do with being comfortable with themselves.</p>

<h3>Disparaging Remarks</h3>
<p>Within the industry that is entertainment there's been disparaging remarks made about women in Hip-Hop by men. In July of 2019 Jermaine Dupri made controversial comments about the lyrics female rappers are putting out. According to Billboard, “Back in July, Jermaine Dupri commented on female rap culture that immediately sparked controversy. “I feel they’re all rapping about the same thing,” he exclaimed during a PEOPLE interview. “I don’t think they’re showing us who’s the best rapper. For me, it’s like strippers rapping and as far as rap goes I’m not getting who’s the best rapper”.”</p>

<p>Jermaine Dupri’s comments weren’t ignored. He was met with backlash from female rappers like Cardi B and Doja Cat for his misogynistic comments, and other celebrities backed them up. According to Billboard, “Just being a carefree black woman gets under so many men's skin,” says DJ Miss Milan, who also serves as Saweetie’s tour DJ. “Take Megan Thee Stallion for instance. She was getting berated by a bunch of men over the fact that she was constantly twerking. So what? She's rapping better than 99 percent of the male rappers out there”.”</p>

<p>Rico Nasty, a female rapper, didn’t like the comments made by Dupri and shed some light on the double standard that many female rappers are faced with in the industry. Male rappers rap about the female body in a number of songs, however it seems to become a problem when women do it. According to Billboard, “and Rico Nasty “I felt somewhat insulted [by Jermaine Dupri] because I rap about my p---y all the time. There's a lot of songs where girls don't talk about that,” says Rico Nasty. “But if the p---y-popping bangers are what's hitting the clubs, then that's what you're going to hear all the time. You know how many times men rap about the same s--t on more than one song?”</p>

<p>When it comes to men being held to a different standard Megan Thee Stallion had this to say in an interview with revolt, “A man can be as mediocre as he wants to be but still be praised. A man can talk about how he’s about to do all of these drugs and then come and shoot your house up,” she said. “But as soon as I say something about my vagina, it’s the end of the world?”</p>
